              <p>The species is also known as giant protea, honeypot or king sugar bush. It is widely distributed in the southwestern and southern parts of South Africa in the fynbos region.</p>
              <p>The king protea is the national flower of South Africa. It also is the flagship of the Protea Atlas Project, run by the South African National Botanical Institute.</p>

          <h1>Msasa trees</h1>
          <p> Brachystegia spiciformis Benth., commonly known as zebrawood, or Msasa, is a medium-sized African tree having compound leaves and racemes of small fragrant green flowers. The tree is broad and has a distinctive amber and wine red colour when the young leaves sprout during spring (August–September). It grows in savanna, both open woodland and closed woodland of Southern and Eastern Africa, mostly Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique. </p>

          <h1>Britannica</h1>
          <p>This dry, shrubby-looking little plant is deceptive, because it packs a lot of flavor and is used by many North African regions in their cooking. It thrives throughout the Sahara.</p>
          <p> Saharan vegetation is generally sparse, with scattered concentrations of grasses, shrubs, and trees in the highlands, in oasis depressions, and along the wadis. Various halophytes (salt-tolerant plants) are found in saline depressions. Some heat- and drought-tolerant grasses, herbs, small shrubs, and trees are found on the less well-watered plains and plateaus of the Sahara.</p>

        <h2>Covid-19</h2>
        <p>The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) has generated an unprecedented impact in most countries of the world. The virus has affected almost every country on the planet (213 in total), spread to more than 2 million people, and caused around 130,000 deaths (WHO, 2020a).
          Currently, most countries have tried to fight the spread of the virus with massive COVID-19 screening tests and establishing public policies of social distancing. It is clear that the priority revolves around people's health.</p>

        <p>Air quality is essential for people's health; however, 91% of the world population lives in places where poor air quality exceeds the permissible limits (WHO, 2016). The consequences of air quality degradation are manifested in a significant percentage of global mortality each year (Zhang et al., 2017). In this regard, the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) report indicates that air pollution contributes to almost 8% of total deaths in the world; the most affected   countries       being those found in Africa, Asia and part of Europe (WHO, 2016).
            China implemented strict traffic restrictions and self-quarantine measures to control the expansion of SARS-CoV2. These actions generated changes in air pollution. Due to quarantine, NO2 was reduced by 22.8 μg/m3 and 12.9 μg/m3 in Wuhan and China, respectively. PM 2.5 fell by 1.4 μg/m3 in Wuhan but decreased by 18.9 μg/m3 in 367 cities.</p>
