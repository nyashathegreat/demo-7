            <li> <h2>The Savanna Story</h2> </li>
            <p>Although large parts of the Miombo are relatively intact, natural woodlands are being cleared to meet other land needs: agriculture, ranching and charcoal production.

Illegal hunting, especially for rhino horn and elephant ivory, are also major threats to this unique environment.

WWF is working throughout the region to conserve the woodlands and to help meet human needs and development through the sustainable use of natural resources. This includes conservation agriculture and sustainable charcoal production.

              What is Savanna?
              Savanna is similar to grassland but with scattered trees. These areas have seasons: cool and dry, hot and dry followed by warm and wet. All savanna areas have a wet and dry season.
              Nearer the equator the heavy rainfall during the wet season, and the fairly high total amount of rainfall during the dry season encourages vegetation to grow. This vegetation includes thick lush grass and heavily wooded areas. Away from the equator, vegetation in the form of trees and poor quality grasses are only found near rivers and water holes.

                What is the impact of humans on Savanna?
                Indigenous People (native people) - Savanna areas are popular with nomads (people who move from place to place) e.g. Massai tribe of Kenya. This method of farming can be beneficial to the environment. Grazing animals are not kept in just one area. They are moved from place to place, allowing vegetation to recover. However, in times of serious drought animals can remove the scarce vegetation cover. This leaves the soil prone to erosion. Desertification (land turning to desert) occurs in extreme cases.
                Tourism - The rich variety of wildlife in savanna areas attracts many tourists on safari. Transport used by the tourists often damages vegetation and scares the wildlife.

                  What is the future for the Savanna? - Sustainable Development
                  If development in areas of savanna is to be sustainable (e.g. although the resources are used to aid development, it/they will still exist for future generations to use) ecotourism must be further developed. You can find out more about ecotourism here.

                Temperatures are fairly stable with little change between seasons, the greatest temperature between day and night usually averaging a change of 15° C.
                Temperatures range between 20° and 27° C
                Near some river tributaries, the area cools to as low as 12° C
                Humidity averages around 80 – 90 percent
                Soil of the Congo Basin
                The area is heavily coarse grained soils.
                About 60% contains sand and gravel, with the lower lying areas having a high level of iron and aluminum oxides.
                The soils are rich and heavy, as organic matter decomposes rapidly because of the hot and humid climate, and also topsoil is washed away regularly by rains.
